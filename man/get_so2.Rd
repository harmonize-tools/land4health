\title{Extract Sulphur Dioxide data of Sentinel5}
\usage{
get_so2(from, to, band, region, fun = "max", scale = 1000)
}
\arguments{
\item{to, from}{it's a string object,starting and final date.}

\item{band}{name of band.}

\item{region}{is a feature or feature collection.}

\item{fun}{function for extract statistic zonal (count, kurtosis, max, mean, median, min, mode, percentile, std, sum, variance, first).}

\item{scale}{A nominal scale in meters of the projection to work in.}
}
\value{
a tibble object with the new variables.
}
\description{
A function that extract a time series of Sulphur Dioxide (2018-07-10T11:17:44Z - 2022-05-15T00:00:00).
}
\details{
Name of some bands.
\itemize{
\item \bold{SO2_column_number_density (mol/m²):} SO2 vertical column density at ground level, calculated using the DOAS technique.
\item \bold{SO2_column_number_density_amf (mol/m²):} Weighted mean of cloudy and clear air mass factor (amf) weighted by intensity-weighted cloud fraction.
\item \bold{SO2_slant_column_number_density (mol/m²):} SO2 ring corrected slant column number density.
\item \bold{cloud_fraction:} Effective cloud fraction. See the Sentinel 5P L2 Input/Output Data Definition Spec, p.220.
\item \bold{sensor_azimuth_angle (degree): } Azimuth angle of the satellite at the ground pixel location (WGS84); angle measured East-of-North.
\item \bold{sensor_zenith_angle (degree):} Zenith angle of the satellite at the ground pixel location (WGS84); angle measured away from the vertical.
\item \bold{solar_azimuth_angle (degree):} Azimuth angle of the Sun at the ground pixel location (WGS84); angle measured East-of-North.
\item \bold{solar_zenith_angle (degree):} Zenith angle of the satellite at the ground pixel location (WGS84); angle measured away from the vertical.
\item \bold{SO2_column_number_density_15km (mol/m²):} SO2 vertical column density at 15km, calculated using the DOAS technique.
